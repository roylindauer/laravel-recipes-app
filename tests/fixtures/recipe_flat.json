    "description": "“It’s the only place where you can find a giant vat of peeled garlic, because it’s the only place that truly understands how much garlic you’ll need for the kind of food your people eat,” Michelle Zauner writes about the supermarket H Mart in her memoir, “Crying in H Mart.” Thankfully, many other grocery stores now sell containers of peeled garlic cloves. If you don’t already buy those, then this recipe is a great reason to start. Chicken thighs, white pepper, chardonnay and 20 garlic cloves are all you need for this zinger of a one-pot meal, which braises in an hour. In that time, chicken fat, wine and water turn into a luscious sauce packed with garlicky redolence. The white pepper, musky and full of earthiness, is a key taste here, so don’t skip it.",

That’s what you’re going for here. If it’s flabby, the fat wasn’t adequately rendered. Start at a lower heat, render, then crank up to finish crisping in fat"

I've tried to replicate her chicken but have never got it exactly right! Gonna try this recipe, using more liquid and adding the rice w. about 25 mins to go. (By any objective measure, her rice was overcooked, but that didn't seem to matter: it was so good. Tempted to stir the rice into the oil *before* the liquid and let it cook w the chicken for the full hour!)"

Used chicken broth instead of water which helped with the flavor.  In the oven I left the cover on for 30 minutes and removed it for the last 30 minutes. This reduced the liquid so that there was enough to enjoy with rice, but not so much to consider it \"soup\". One could embellish this recipe but I was quite satisfied with the pure basic flavors."
